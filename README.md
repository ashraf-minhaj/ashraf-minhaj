Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

What to say... well... AWS is my Crush, Python is my love, making DIY gadgets and robots are my hobby, love to have tech talk & share knowledge. I usually talk in two programming languages, but understand many more, want to catch up?

Here you'll find some AWS realted projects written in terraform, some cool fun robots which I thought would be serious, more significantly, here's Ashraf Minhaj!
